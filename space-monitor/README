This directory contains examples of using the GigaSpaces XAP Admin API
to monitor a running space.

The important design goals of this project include:
  - Minimize impact on the running system
  - Decouple the capture of metrics from the analysis and presentation
    of results
  - Support pluggable, composable output mechanisms
  - Allow simple configuration of which metrics to capture

All metrics are output as a comma separated value list in RFC 4180
format with this structure:

  timestamp,metric-type,value-1,value-2,...,value-n

where timestamp is in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.  There may
be different numbers of values for different metric types.
