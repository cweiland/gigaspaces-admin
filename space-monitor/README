This directory contains examples of using the GigaSpaces XAP Admin API
to monitor a running space.

The important design goals of this project include:
  - Minimize impact on the running system
  - Decouple the capture of metrics from the analysis and presentation
    of results
  - Support pluggable, composable output mechanisms
  - Allow simple configuration of which metrics to capture

All metrics are output as a comma separated value list in RFC 4180
format with this structure:

  timestamp,space-name,metric-type,value-1,value-2,...,value-n

where timestamp is in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.  There may
be different numbers of values for different metric types.

To build the space monitor, set your JSHOMEDIR environment variable to
the GigaSpaces XAP installation directory and then run 'ant build'.

To run the space monitor, set your LOOKUPLOCATORS or LOOKUPGROUPS
environment variable and run 'bin/monitor'.  By default, the output
will be written to /tmp/space-monitor.log.
